# Homesite Quote Conversion Project
## Project Overview
This repository focuses on the Homesite Quote Conversion challenge, using advanced ML techniques to predict whether customers will purchase a given insurance plan. By balancing datasets with SMOTE and employing a variety of algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, MLP, and KNN), I've optimized model performance, achieving a higher prediction accuracy through rigorous hyperparameter tuning

## Data Source
Data from [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/homesite-quote-conversion]

## Tools
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Preparation/Data Cleaning
Initial data preparation steps included:

Handling missing values

Balancing the dataset using SMOTE to improve minority class representation

## Results
The model demonstrated a significant score in predicting quote conversions, with an overall accuracy of 90%

## Future Directions
Model Experimentation: Further explore ensemble methods and deep learning architectures

Feature Engineering: Investigate the impact of additional feature creation on model performance, such as XGBoost or deeper exploration of hyperparameter tuning

Data Augmentation: Consider synthetic data generation techniques to enhance training datasets further

Deployment: Plan for the deployment of selected models into a production environment for real-time predictions
